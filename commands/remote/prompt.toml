prompt = """
Parse the arguments to extract the sandbox name and the user's prompt.

The format is expected to be: <sandbox-name> <user-prompt>

For example: "/remote:prompt my-sandbox write a hello world script" means:
- Sandbox name: my-sandbox
- User prompt: write a hello world script

Use the send_prompt_to_sandbox tool with the command: cd /sandbox && gemini -y -p "<user-prompt>"

This will execute Gemini CLI inside the sandbox with the user's prompt.

Display the results clearly:
- The prompt that was sent
- Output from Gemini CLI
- Exit code

If there are any errors, explain what might have gone wrong.

Arguments: {{args}}
